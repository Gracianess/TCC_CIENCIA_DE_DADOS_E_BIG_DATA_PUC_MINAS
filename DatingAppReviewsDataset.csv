2,David Hume,Still doesn't correctly notify matches or messages. It's a monopoly so expect zero improvement in functionality. Overpriced. The recently added features like date night ask infantile and western culture based questions. Western dating culture is pure evil. The marketing tactics are designed to manipulate and extract money from men and while hiding how the app works.

I used to always get lots of likes when I wasn't a premium member in years past but now that they've asked me to pay an absurd amount of money there have been zero likes in a week after I paid. Seems to line up with other reviews. *Edit* I have now figured out the algorithm. As soon as I left and stopped using the app, I started getting all sorts of new likes and alerts of new matches.

"1644,christy ramsdell,""They had my review deleted, lol. Well here it is again, with one less star: This app is laughable. They must be trying to tank it intentionally. You can't see who likes you or message them without a subscription. But why would I pay for an app I'm not sure id like if I can't test it out? I did use Tinder ~2017 and it was fully functional in the free version, with upgrades I could (and did) pay to use. This current version boggles the mind. You can only create a profile.

Usually it takes weeks to get even one match(unless my subscription expires, than all of a sudden I have 10+ matches) and so I've come to the conclusion that females on Tinder just aren't cut out for me. So, I joined Bumble and tbh I've got 13 matches in 24hrs and still getting more. So no more money for Tinder."",1,174,27-01-2022 20:12,Tinder";;

6213,Toran Tanner,Tinder is a worthless app for dating 80% of female profile are sex workers trying sling the nudes or they are hookers. The 20% consists of women who match but don't talk which makes me believe they are only there for validation and follows. Tinder needs to implement some for of punishment for not engaging with matches and making verified profiles mandatory. The apps algorithms are also broken only benefiting those who are popular. Very much dislike this app doesn't even deserve 1 star.,1,1,12-01-2022 23:01,Tinder;;
